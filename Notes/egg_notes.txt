android Toast object - notifier but must call .show()

ListView - must have "android:layout_gravity" attribute
	ListView.FixedViewInfo - header/footer... constant reminder of "who" made it

ProgressBar - indicator displayed as saving

CheckBox/RadioButton

RelativeLayout
	RelativeLayout.LayoutParams
	
Scroller/ScrollView

Slide between views rather than completely new page?

ActionBar
	ActionBar.Tab
	ActionBar.TabListener
	OR TabWidget - maintain info in fields between swiping/clicking tab
	
		@Override
		public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		    ...
		
		    // Create a tab listener that is called when the user changes tabs.
		    ActionBar.TabListener tabListener = new ActionBar.TabListener() {
		        public void onTabSelected(ActionBar.Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft) {
		            // When the tab is selected, switch to the
		            // corresponding page in the ViewPager.
		            mViewPager.setCurrentItem(tab.getPosition());
		        }
		        ...
		    };
		}

VideoView - show user how to use app
	-perhaps it plays as soon as it's opened the first time and then delete it?

ViewPager
	ViewPager.OnPageChangeListener 
	 	-interface to change the current tab each time the page changes
	ViewAnimator/ViewSwitcher/ViewFlipper

PagerTitleStrip - instead of ActionBar w/Tabs

/** 1.2 SQLite Date and Time Datatype

	SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates 
	and/or times. Instead, the built-in Date And Time Functions of SQLite 
	are capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values:

		TEXT as ISO8601 strings ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS").
		REAL as Julian day numbers, the number of days since noon in Greenwich 
			on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
		INTEGER as Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.

	Applications can chose to store dates and times in any of these 
	formats and freely convert between formats using the built-in date 
	and time functions.
