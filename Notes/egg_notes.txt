android Toast object - notifier but must call .show()

ListView - must have "android:layout_gravity" attribute
	ListView.FixedViewInfo - header/footer... constant reminder of "who" made it

ProgressBar - indicator displayed as saving

CheckBox/RadioButton

RelativeLayout
	RelativeLayout.LayoutParams
	
Scroller/ScrollView

Slide between views rather than completely new page?

ActionBar
	ActionBar.Tab
	ActionBar.TabListener
	OR TabWidget - maintain info in fields between swiping/clicking tab
	
		@Override
		public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
		    ...
		
		    // Create a tab listener that is called when the user changes tabs.
		    ActionBar.TabListener tabListener = new ActionBar.TabListener() {
		        public void onTabSelected(ActionBar.Tab tab, FragmentTransaction ft) {
		            // When the tab is selected, switch to the
		            // corresponding page in the ViewPager.
		            mViewPager.setCurrentItem(tab.getPosition());
		        }
		        ...
		    };
		}

VideoView - show user how to use app
	-perhaps it plays as soon as it's opened the first time and then delete it?

ViewPager
	ViewPager.OnPageChangeListener 
	 	-interface to change the current tab each time the page changes
	ViewAnimator/ViewSwitcher/ViewFlipper

PagerTitleStrip - instead of ActionBar w/Tabs
